# cooking-with-code
SUMMARY:

This site will eventually be a place where home cooks can come to save old recipe and expedite their shopping.  Cooks will be able to create recipes with an ingredient list and when it comes time for shopping (the worst part of cooking) this site will give users the ability to select multiple recipes and export a shopping list for all the ingredients required.  Before exporting they will be able to unselect items they already own (like salt, pepper,...).  Each ingredient will have a grocery store section attribute allowing an exported list to look something like this:

Meats:

  	1 pound ground beef
  
Vegetables:

	4 large tomatoes
	carrots
	zucchini
	parsley
Other:

	red wine
	8 ounce tomatoe sauce
  
  
REQUIRES (currently):

	  npm install
	  npm start
  
  
TODO:

	  integrate database with api
	  build more beautiful front end
	  add in addition features like rating or searching for recipies
